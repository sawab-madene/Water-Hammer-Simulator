# Water-Hammer-Simulator
This work consists of developing algorithms that allow us to calculate the flow and pressure variations of different hydraulic configurations: 
1. without protection 
2. protected by Surge tank 
3. protected by an air chamber
 
Based on method of characteristics which is a technique for solving partial differential equations ,it is designed and developed in the open source environment **(Python 3.7)** and validated by a third party software.
